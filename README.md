### In the project directory, you can run:

##### First, we’ll need to build Storybook as a static web application using build-storybook, a command that’s installed by default. 

### `yarn build-storybook -o ./path/to/build`

##### Storybook will create a static web application at the path you specify. This can be served by any web server. Try it out locally by running:

### `npx http-server ./path/to/build`
